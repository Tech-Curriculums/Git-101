# Feature-Branch Workflow


Suppose you finally got working code and don't want to mess it up.
Instead of changing that, make a copy of it and work on the copy.

Make a copy of the main branch (master), name it after your new feature.
In our example we are giving our website "telekinesis".

### check your current branches (should come up with a unique name)

gif of above

```sh
git branch
```

### make a new branch named after your feature

```sh
git branch <feature-name>
```
type `git branch` again and note you have another branch :smile:
